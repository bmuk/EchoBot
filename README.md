EchoBot
=======

A Twitter bot that echos anything you tweet to it.

Requirements
------------

To run this bot you simply need tweepy, which can be installed using
pip -
`sudo pip install tweepy`

If you want to actually run the bot on twitter, you will need to
create an application account, and provide the script with your
credentials, in the form of a config file. A sample config file has
been provided for your convenience (config.example). Keep in mind that
the configuration file is a python file - so save yours as config.py.
